### Changed

- Unknown tool names in `tools/call`, including read-only-gated write tools, now return generic JSON-RPC Invalid params errors instead of Method not found.
- JSON-RPC protocol errors now use generic messages such as `parse error`, `invalid request`, `invalid params`, `method not found`, and `internal error`.
- `PathGuard` now accepts an explicit filesystem security policy while keeping the default constructor compatible.
- `list_files` now filters hidden and denied link/reparse entries according to policy.
- Moved protocol definitions from `pkg/protocol` to `internal/protocol`.
- Removed the public `pkg` package layout in favor of internal packages.
- Refactored filesystem operations into focused files.
- Updated supported MCP protocol version from `2025-06-18` to `2025-11-25`.
- Split CLI and server bootstrap responsibilities.
- Extracted tool registry bootstrap.
- Extracted router bootstrap.
- Updated README with build, usage, CLI, release, tool, and smoke-test information.
- Updated roadmap handling so planned work is tracked in `BACKLOG.md`.
- Updated GitHub Actions versions to Node-24-compatible major versions:
  - `actions/checkout@v7`
  - `actions/setup-go@v6`
  - `actions/upload-artifact@v6`

### Fixed

- Stabilized golangci-lint execution in CI by installing the expected linter version.
- Removed Node.js 20 deprecation annotations from CI and release workflows.
- Improved release artifact visibility in GitHub Actions.
- Validated JSON-RPC smoke-test behavior locally and in CI.

### Security

- Sprint 3.38 validates JSON-RPC envelopes before dispatch, rejects unsupported batches, suppresses responses for notifications, prevents `tools/call` notification execution, serializes unknown IDs as `id:null`, and converts handler panics to generic Internal error responses.
- Sprint 3.36 adds effective path validation through `PathGuard` using evaluated existing paths and evaluated nearest existing parents for create targets.
- Sprint 3.36 rejects symlink-based filesystem escapes that resolve outside the configured root.
- Sprint 3.36 maps security/path denials to generic invalid-params tool errors without exposing host paths.
- Sprint 3.35 enforces `MCP_READ_ONLY=true` at tool registration time by exposing only `list_files`, `read_file`, `stat_path`, and `exists_path`.
- Sprint 3.35 prevents direct `tools/call` execution of write-capable tools in read-only mode because those tools are not registered.
- Filesystem paths are resolved through a sandbox root.
- Absolute user paths are rejected.
- Parent directory traversal is rejected.
- Destructive operations use conservative defaults.
- Tool implementations do not bypass the filesystem abstraction.
- Normal MCP operation reserves standard output for JSON-RPC protocol messages.
- Diagnostic output is kept separate from the JSON-RPC stream.
