# ADR-0003: Use STDIO Transport

## Status

Accepted

## Context

MCP servers commonly communicate with clients through standard input and standard output.

The target clients for `fileserver-mcp` include:

- Claude Desktop
- Codex-compatible tooling
- other MCP-compatible clients

The server should not require opening a network port for normal operation.

During early development an HTTP health-check server was used only to verify the Go toolchain. That HTTP approach is not part of the final transport architecture.

## Decision

`fileserver-mcp` will use STDIO as its primary and initially only transport.

The server reads JSON-RPC messages from `stdin` and writes JSON-RPC responses to `stdout`.

Diagnostic output must go to `stderr`.

## Rationale

STDIO is appropriate because:

- it matches common MCP client integration patterns
- it avoids exposing a network port
- it avoids Windows Firewall prompts
- it keeps deployment simple
- it works on Windows and Linux
- it is easy to launch as a child process from MCP clients

## Consequences

### Positive

- No TCP listener is required.
- No firewall exception is required.
- The server is simple to run from desktop MCP clients.
- STDIO is easy to test with controlled input/output streams.
- Protocol traffic remains isolated from diagnostic logs.

### Negative

- The server is process-bound to the launching client.
- Remote use requires a separate wrapper or transport layer.
- Long-running diagnostics must not write to `stdout`, otherwise JSON-RPC communication may break.

## Implementation Rules

- `stdout` is reserved for MCP protocol messages.
- `stderr` is used for logs and diagnostics.
- The transport layer must not contain business logic.
- The transport layer must not directly execute tools.
- The transport layer must only read and write protocol messages.

## Current Impact

Transport code is located under:

```text
internal/mcp/transport
```

The current `cmd/server/main.go` is only a bootstrap placeholder until the real MCP server wiring is completed.
