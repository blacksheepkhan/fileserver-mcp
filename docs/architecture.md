# Architecture

`fileserver-mcp` is a high-performance Model Context Protocol (MCP) server written in Go.

The project is structured as a layered application with strict separation between protocol handling, tool execution, security validation and filesystem access.

## Architectural Goals

The primary architectural goals are:

- predictable behavior
- low resource usage
- cross-platform support for Windows and Linux
- secure-by-default filesystem access
- clear testability
- long-term maintainability
- no dependency on external MCP protocol libraries

## Layers

### `cmd/server`

Contains only the application entry point.

The `main` package must not contain application logic. It is responsible only for:

- loading configuration
- wiring dependencies
- starting the server
- reporting fatal startup errors

### `internal/config`

Contains immutable application configuration.

Configuration is loaded from defaults and environment variables. Future configuration sources may include configuration files and command-line flags.

### `internal/security`

Contains security-sensitive validation logic.

Currently this package provides:

- `PathGuard`
- `SafePath`
- sandbox root validation
- path traversal protection
- absolute path rejection

No package outside `internal/security` should implement its own path validation rules.

### `internal/fs`

Contains all direct filesystem access.

No production code outside this package should use filesystem operations such as:

- `os.ReadFile`
- `os.WriteFile`
- `os.ReadDir`
- `os.Remove`
- `os.Rename`
- `os.Open`

The filesystem package exposes a controlled `FileSystem` interface that is used by MCP tools.

### `internal/mcp`

Contains the MCP runtime components:

- transport
- router
- handlers
- tools
- server runtime

The MCP layer must not directly access the operating system filesystem.

### `internal/protocol`

Contains protocol data structures only.

This package should not contain business logic.

## Dependency Direction

Dependencies must point inward toward lower-level abstractions.

Allowed examples:

```text
mcp/tools -> fs
fs        -> security
server    -> router, transport, protocol
```

Disallowed examples:

```text
security -> fs
fs       -> mcp
protocol -> server
```

## Filesystem Core

The filesystem core currently supports:

- list
- read
- stat
- exists
- write
- mkdir
- delete
- move
- copy
- rename

All operations are sandboxed through `PathGuard`.

## Design Principles

### Single Responsibility

Each package and file should have one clear responsibility.

### Dependency Injection

Components should receive dependencies explicitly.

### Secure Defaults

Potentially destructive operations must be conservative by default.

Examples:

- file writes do not overwrite unless explicitly requested
- directory deletion is not recursive unless explicitly requested
- directory copy is intentionally unsupported in the initial implementation

### Small Files

Large implementation files should be split by responsibility.

The filesystem implementation is split into focused files:

```text
filesystem.go
list.go
read.go
stat.go
write.go
delete.go
move.go
copy.go
```

## Current Status

The foundation layer is implemented and tested.

The MCP protocol layer is currently a skeleton and will be completed in a later sprint.
