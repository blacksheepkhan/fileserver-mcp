# Backlog ID Migration - 2026-07-20

## Status

Completed documentation migration in PR #19. The new IDs become authoritative when the PR is merged.

## Reason

Two operating-system-specific release metadata tasks were inserted at the technically appropriate position before the existing artifact-verification task:

- `BL-246`: native Windows file and product metadata
- `BL-247`: native Linux binary and package metadata

A separate dependency-maintenance task was appended as `BL-324`:

- `BL-324`: Dependabot security and version updates

The project rule requires all active canonical IDs to remain continuous after inserting tasks.

## Canonical range

The canonical catalog now remains continuous through:

```text
BL-001 through BL-324
```

## Renumbering rule

All previously active canonical IDs from `BL-246` through `BL-321` move forward by two positions:

```text
BL-246 -> BL-248
...
BL-321 -> BL-323
```

The new `BL-324` task is appended and therefore does not replace a previous ID.

Historical migration files remain immutable. In particular, `docs/backlog-id-migration-2026-07-17.md` and earlier dated records retain the identifiers valid at their respective dates.

## New tasks

| ID | Task | Position |
|---|---|---|
| BL-246 | Embed native Windows file and product metadata | Inserted before artifact verification |
| BL-247 | Define and publish native Linux binary and package metadata | Inserted before artifact verification |
| BL-324 | Configure Dependabot security and version updates | Appended after the PR #15 follow-up tasks |

## Validation result

- Canonical IDs are continuous from `BL-001` through `BL-324`.
- Every canonical ID occurs exactly once in `BACKLOG.md`.
- The three new tasks occur exactly once.
- All previously active IDs from `BL-246` through `BL-321` are mapped forward by two positions.
- Active sprint, release-gate, documentation, provider, benchmark-CI, and PR #15 references use the new IDs.
- Earlier dated migration files remain unchanged as historical evidence.
