# Security Model

`fileserver-mcp` is designed as a secure-by-default filesystem MCP server.

Filesystem access is security-sensitive because MCP clients may request operations on local files. For this reason, all filesystem operations are restricted to a configured sandbox root.

## Core Security Principles

### Sandbox Root

All filesystem paths are resolved relative to a configured root directory.

The root is configured through:

```text
MCP_ROOT
```

If no root is provided, the default root is:

```text
.
```

Production deployments should explicitly set `MCP_ROOT`.

### No Direct Filesystem Access Outside `internal/fs`

Production code outside `internal/fs` must not directly call filesystem APIs such as:

- `os.ReadFile`
- `os.WriteFile`
- `os.ReadDir`
- `os.Remove`
- `os.Rename`
- `os.Open`
- `os.Stat`

All filesystem access must go through the `FileSystem` abstraction.

### Central Path Validation

Path validation is centralized in:

```text
internal/security/PathGuard
```

No other package should implement independent path validation.

## PathGuard

`PathGuard` validates and resolves user-provided paths against the sandbox root.

It protects against:

- empty root paths
- absolute user paths
- parent directory traversal
- resolved paths outside the sandbox root

## SafePath

`SafePath` represents a path that has passed validation.

Only `PathGuard` creates `SafePath` values.

This prevents unvalidated user input from being passed directly to filesystem operations.

## Blocked Path Types

### Absolute Paths

User-provided absolute paths are rejected.

Examples:

```text
C:\Windows\System32
/etc/passwd
```

### Parent Traversal

Parent traversal is rejected.

Examples:

```text
..
../secret.txt
../../outside-root
```

### Outside Root Resolution

Even after cleaning and resolving a path, the final path must remain inside the configured sandbox root.

## Destructive Operations

Destructive operations are intentionally conservative.

### Write

`Write()` does not overwrite existing files unless `overwrite=true`.

### Delete

`Delete()` does not delete non-empty directories unless `recursive=true`.

### Move

`Move()` does not overwrite existing targets unless `overwrite=true`.

### Copy

`Copy()` does not overwrite existing targets unless `overwrite=true`.

Directory copy is currently unsupported by design.

## Symlinks

Symlink handling is not yet fully implemented.

Current behavior uses standard filesystem calls. A later security sprint will define explicit symlink policy based on configuration.

Planned configuration:

```text
MCP_FOLLOW_SYMLINKS
```

## UNC Paths

UNC path handling is not yet fully implemented.

Planned configuration:

```text
MCP_ALLOW_UNC_PATHS
```

The default will remain secure: UNC paths are not allowed unless explicitly enabled.

## Hidden Files

Hidden file handling is not yet fully implemented.

Planned configuration:

```text
MCP_ALLOW_HIDDEN_FILES
```

## Security Testing

Security tests currently cover:

- empty root rejection
- absolute path rejection
- path traversal rejection
- root normalization
- safe path metadata
- filesystem traversal rejection across list/read/stat/exists/write/mkdir/delete/move/copy

## Future Security Work

Planned future work:

- explicit symlink validation
- Windows UNC path validation
- hidden file policy
- read-only mode enforcement
- maximum response size
- maximum directory listing size
- audit logging
